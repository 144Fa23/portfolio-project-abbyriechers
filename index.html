            <p>Every since I was a little kid I wanted to teach, I would have a pointer in my and taught my stuffed animals. It's surreal that that I will be in a classroom this time next year. I start student teaching Spring 2024 and I can't believe how fast the time has flown by. I'm so excited but also very nervous, but I know this will make my heart happy and can't wait for the adventure ahead.</p>
