        <p>I believe that all students are unique and need all four of their psychological needs met to succeed in a classroom and grow in all aspects of life. It is my goal to make sure every student is receiving everything they need to succeed in my classroom, whether it be accommodations to an assignment or one of their needs. Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs is an idea that states if the five needs are met motivation will be higher. I plan to instill those five needs into my classroom so students are more motivated. I want to provide an environment for my students where they feel safe and comfortable to speak up and take risks without feeling scared.</p>
    <p>I believe that the teacher is the role model for how students should act in the classroom, like Ginott states in his classroom management model. The teacher is the one person they see in front of them every day, and for some students they become a role model. The students want to start acting like the teacher. It could be the way they treat others or their personality. As a teacher I can’t expect my students to act one way if I can’t even do it.</p>
    <p>I also agree a lot with the choice theory by Glasser, which says every individual has only the power to control themselves and has limited power to control others. Every student should only be worried about themselves and ways they need to improve, they can’t control the way one of their peers does something, but they can control what they do.</p>
    <p>When it comes to the environment or culture of my room, building a relationship with my students will go a long way, they will feel safer in my classroom, and they will feel more comfortable talking to me and be willing to ask for help. I’ve learned that establishing a relationship with students can help in all aspects while teaching. As well, I will foster relationships with parents; they should always be involved and in the loop with what their student is doing at school. I will advocate for my students, and set high expectations for them, so they know I care about them and want them to do well. I plan to use Kagan strategies to help my class build relationships with each other, helping it become a positive inclusive classroom. Helping students create relationships with each other and create a sense of community in the classroom.</p>

    <p>As teacher I need to establish relationships with my students, helping them feel safe in my classroom. I need to make sure parents are in the loop and I am communicating with them and accommodating to them if a meeting is needed for a situation. My students have needs that need to be met, as well as psychological needs, so they can succeed in my classroom. It is my goal as a teacher to create an environment for my students that is inviting and encourages them to take risks. I will do what I can to help my students and push them to be the best version of themselves.
