            <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Kansas City, in a city Blue Springs. I am someone who love their hometown and I do not want to move far away! I know that kind of crazy but I've always been a home body and I dont see that changing any time soon!</p>
            
            <p>Around the age of 6 I started dancing, at the time I had no idea that's what I would be doing for a long time. I quit soccer at the time so I had more time to take classes. I stayed in a studio until my junior year of high school. Through out those years I had the opportunity to teach the younger kids, and even visually impared students. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget.</p>
            
            <p>Even though dance took up majority of my time I did enjoy doing other things when I had the chance!</p>
